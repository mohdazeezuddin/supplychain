Summary:
We first begin with exploring the historical sales data i.e we try to understand the distribution of data, trends and seasonality. Then we extract useful features such as any day of the week, month or any holiday which can affect the sales. Then we split the data into training and test data. Then we train the selected model and evaluate it's performance. We also finne tune the hyper-parameters of the model to imrpove its performance. Once the model is ready, we ue it to forecast sales for the next 12 weeks for each SKU-store combination.
Issues faced:
1. The lack of additional information about stores and products made the model's ability to capture certain patterns difficult.
2. Identifying and handling the outliers/anomalies was also a big task.
3. Removing inconsistencies in the data was also big task.

Result:
Sales values for next 12 weeks were similar to others except for one week which had very high sales in that week.
